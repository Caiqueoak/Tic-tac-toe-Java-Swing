# Tic Tac Toe using Java Swing

I made this game with two frames: a menu frame and a gameboard frame. In the menu you have three options: Player x CPU, Player x Player and CPU x CPU. 

The side you are (O or X), who starts first and the CPU's movements are randomly chosen.

Gameboard frame: its has the gameboard, the game state panel, the score, the reset button and the menu button.

- Game state panel: shows who's the turn and result of the game.

- Reset button: resets the state of the game but preserving the sides (if player 1 was X then he will be X until the players return to the menu)

- Menu button: returns to the menu, resets the score and memory about the players sides.
